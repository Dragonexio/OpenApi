## Public Request Headers

1. Pubic Request Headers

    | key | is necessary | desc |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | auth | Yes | Authentication string derived from `${access_key}:${sign}`, in which `${access_key}` is the access_key in the open api keys obtained from our official website, and `${sign}` is the signature(refer to the [Sign section](#Request Sign Mechanism)  below) |
    | token | Yes | Token obtained from interface [/api/v1/token/new/](./1.interface_document_v1.md). except the interface for obtaining token, other `POST` requests must be transmitted into this field, and the server will authenticate this `token` in addition to `auth` above. |
    | Content-Type | No | [MIME](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME) type of content.  |
    | Content-Sha1 | No | SHA1 value of HTTP message body (**Note: SHA1 rather than MD5**) |
    | Date | Yes | **UTC time. If you are in area of UTC+8, this time is 8 hours later compare with your local time.** The request will be rejected if this time not within 15min compare with server time. Please check [HTTP-date](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.2) for exact format. |

1. Notes
    1. All requests must contain public request headers mentioned above.
    1. In addition to using open api key for identity authentication, we also add token to ensure security:
        1. Obtain request token through `/api/v1/token/new/`, which will be valid for 24 hours. It shall be re-obtained when its validity expires. Each pair of open api keys can create maximum 100 times each calendar day.
        2. Each pair of open api keys is only effective to one token and the token requested later will kick the token requested earlier off line.
            1. The system will delete the old token and then apply for a new one, so when the maximum limit of token requests is reached in a day, the last token won’t be kept and the key becomes ineffective to any additional token. 
            2. If the maximum limit of token requests for the key is reached, and you do not want to wait till the next day, you may apply for a new key. 
            3. The interface will accordingly return different codes for token error. We will return different codes for "invalid token" and "Token kicked off", and the program can handle them accordingly depending on the state code. 
            4. If it indicates that token is kicked offline, and it is not done by you, then the key might be compromised. At this moment you may interrupt the hacker by keeping requesting new tokens. If the maximum limit of token requests for this key is reached in this day, no one can request any additional token. But this key still can request new tokens the next day, so it must be reset to prevent asset loss. 
        3. If HEADERS contain `Content-Sha1`, the backend will authenticate Sha1 of the incoming message, and if not, this authentication won’t be done. 
        4. `Date` must be transmitted (if `Date` can’t be set, it can be replaced with `Date2`. Accordingly `Date2` shall be used when signing)

## Request Sign Mechanism

1. Request Sign Mechanism

    User may get `access_key` and `secret_key` from website, and among them `access_key` is used to identify the visitor and `secret_key` is used to sign at user side and to authenticate the signature at service side. Please properly keep your keys and don’t disclose them to any other party.

1. To facilitate calibration, we provide signature calibration tool: [signature-demo](https://exproductdiag891.blob.core.windows.net/oauth/signature/signature-demo.html)

1. Signature calculation method

    ```angular2html
    sign = base64(hmac-sha1(HTTP_METHOD + "\n" 
                    + CONTENT-Sha1 + "\n"     
                    + CONTENT-TYPE + "\n" 
                    + DATE + "\n" 
                    + CanonicalizedDragonExHeaders
                    + Path))
    ```
    1. `HTTP_METHOD`：capital-letter of HTTP Method (such as: PUT, GET, POST, DELETE)
    2. `CONTENT-Sha1`：Sha1 value of content data. If the requested Header doesn’t transmit Content-Sha1, fill blank(`"""`) string here.
    3. `CONTENT-TYPE`：Type of content. Temporarily only `application/json` is supported.
    4. `DATE`：It indicates the time of current operation and may not be blank. if this time not within 15min compare with server time, an error message will be returned. 
    5. `CanonicalizedDragonExHeaders`：**This is used for user to add user-defined signed headers. If unnecessary, it can be directly filled with blank string `""`**
        - It is a combination of fields that start with `dragonex-` in headers.
        - The key of header will be fully changed to lowercase letters. 
        - If there is no header starting with `dragonex-`, CanonicalizedDragonExHeaders will use blank string `""`.
        - If there are any headers starting with `dragonex-`, fields starting with `dragonex-` will be extracted and ordered upwardly by key. 
        - Put together the key and value in the headers as `${key}:${value}`, leaving no space before and after the colon. 
        - Use line break `\n` to connect each above joined `${key}:${value}`. 
        - Add an extra line break `\n` to the end of the joined results.
    6. `Path`： such as `/account/register` in `https://dragonex.im/account/register`
    7. The string to sign must be UTF-8 format. 
    8. The method of signing uses HMAC-SHA1 defined in [RFC2104](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2104), with secret_key. 

1. Example of Signing
    1. In following example, access_key=ThisIsAccessKey, secret_key=ThisIsSecretKey
    1. Request example:
        1. curl
        
            ```
            curl -H "auth: ThisIsAccessKey:uoKejDFZAfA27eZHbzSsBYoPk4Y=" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Content-Sha1: 123abc" -H "date: Mon, 01 Jan 2018 08:08:08 GMT" -H "Dragonex-Atruth: DragonExIsTheBest" -H "dragonex-btruth: DragonExIsTheBest2" -d "" "https://openapi.dragonex.io/api/v1/token/new/"
            ```
        1. `HTTP_METHOD`：POST
        1. `CONTENT-Sha1`：123abc
        1. `CONTENT-TYPE`：application/json
        1. `DATE`：Mon, 01 Jan 2018 08:08:08 GMT
        1. Change the key of incoming HEADERS fully into lowercase letters: 
        
            ```
            {"auth": "ThisIsAccessKey:uoKejDFZAfA27eZHbzSsBYoPk4Y=",
             "date": "Mon, 01 Jan 2018 08:08:08 GMT",
             "dragonex-btruth": "DragonExIsTheBest2",
             "Dragonex-Atruth": "DragonExIsTheBest",
             "content-type": "application/json",
             "content-sha1": "123abc"
             }
             ```
        1. `CanonicalizedDragonExHeaders`：
            - There are 2 headers start with `dragonex-`
            
                ```
                {"dragonex-btruth": "DragonExIsTheBest2"}`, `{"dragonex-atruth": "DragonExIsTheBest"}
                ```
            - Order upwardly by key: 
            
                ```
                [{"dragonex-atruth": "DragonExIsTheBest"}, {"dragonex-btruth": "DragonExIsTheBest2"}]
                ```
            - Put together the key and value `${key}:${value}`：
            
                ```
                [dragonex-atruth:DragonExIsTheBest, dragonex-btruth:DragonExIsTheBest2]
                ```
            - Use line break to join:
            
                ```angular2html
                dragonex-atruth:DragonExIsTheBest
                dragonex-btruth:DragonExIsTheBest2
                ```
            - Add an extra line break `\n` to the end and get the final `CanonicalizedDragonExHeaders`:
            
                ```angular2html
                dragonex-atruth:DragonExIsTheBest
                dragonex-btruth:DragonExIsTheBest2
  
                ```
        1. `Path`：/api/v1/token/new/
        1. Get final string to sign: 
        
            ```angular2html
            POST
            123abc
            application/json
            Mon, 01 Jan 2018 08:08:08 GMT
            dragonex-atruth:DragonExIsTheBest
            dragonex-btruth:DragonExIsTheBest2
            /api/v1/token/new/
            ```
            
        1. Sign above string with secret_key: 
        
            ```
            vJFxG+J716C7xbTLOM6vI7HPVP4=vJFxG+J716
            ```
            
    1. 	Notes
        1. `CONTENT-TYPE` temporarily only supports `application/json`. 
        2. It is acceptable if `CONTENT-Sha1` is not transmitted. But in this case shal1 value of the message body won’t be authenticated. So its transmission is recommended. 
        3. `CanonicalizedDragonExHeaders` is optional as it is used for user to add any field that requires signing of user. If no such field is used, it is unnecessary to transmit it.

## Request Method
1. RequestHOST： `openapi.dragonex.io` or `openapi.dragonex.im`
1. For `POST` request, message body all uses json format. 
1. Please use https.

## Returned Data Structure

1. Returned Data Structure

    | 参数 | 类型 | 说明 |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | ok | bool | Response status. Success: `true`; failure: `false`.  |
    | code | int | Error code. Success - `1`; failure - corresponding error code.  |
    | msg | string | Reason of error. Success - blank string `""`; failure - reason of error.  |
    | data | Unfixed | Returned data.  |

2. 说明
    1. As each interface contains `ok`, `code` and `msg` that are identical to those in other interfaces, sections below will not cover these three fields again.  
    2. Data field in each interface is different, and sections below will only cover the returned value of this field.
